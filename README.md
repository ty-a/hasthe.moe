# hasthe.moe
An express.js website for uploading files to https://hasthe.moe. It is mostly to give me a chance to play around with Express and web development.

It is still in the very early stages of development, and as such isn't actually being used.

Planned features include
 * Login to restrict who can upload
 * Browse uploaded files
 * A site that looks okay
 * Paste-to-upload on the upload page
 * Way to delete files
 * The next big thing (tm) I haven't realized I want yet
 * Clean code and commenting it, probably.
