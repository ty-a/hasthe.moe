# hasthe.moe
An express.js website for uploading files to https://hasthe.moe. It is mostly to give me a chance to play around with Express and web development.


Features include
 * Uploads restricted via login
 * Browse uploaded files
 * Paste-to-upload on the upload page
 * Way to delete files
 * Account creation (and the ability to turn it off)

 Planned features
 * The next big thing (tm) I haven't realized I want yet
 * Clean code and commenting it, probably.

Features that are up to my interpretation
 * A site that looks okay
